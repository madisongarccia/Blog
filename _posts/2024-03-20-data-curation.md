# Introduction
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span>anding a job fresh out of college can be a tough feat, especially for those trying to find a job in Los Angeles, California. Born and raised in and around the city, I have always planned on returning to the Los Angeles area after college. However, what I did not consider while drawing up this plan, was the current state of the job market. </p>

## Job Outlook for 2024
Position openings for newly-graduated students have on average, been cut in half since 2023, and the average time needed to acquire a job lies around [6 months](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/job-outlook-class-2024-getting-college-grads-hired-7npce/). Many employers are now also requiring more [experience](https://nextgreatstep.com/should-college-grads-fake-it-until-they-make-it/) than the average college graduate has, such as problem-solving, business communication, and leadership. 

## Motivation 
As a student quickly approaching her graduation date, I have taken a strong interest in determining for myself what jobs in my field are currently available in Los Angeles. For this blog, I have chosen to scrape job data for Data Scientist positions from Indeed because it is one of the most popular online job boards throughout the country. In this post, I will explain how and why I was able to use Indeed's website to gather valuable job data in Los Angeles.
