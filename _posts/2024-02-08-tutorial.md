<p> class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>pportunities  in fields related to machine learning, data science, and statistics have grown immensely in recent years, and as students learning how to operate in this realm, it is important to be aware of all the tools available to you. A huge aspect of working in one of the fields listed, is data interpretation, and having the ability to communicate our findings to other career professionals. In order to do both of these jobs effectively, we will need certain tools to help us. One of the leading packages in Python for data visualization and manipulation is Seaborn.</p>


## What Can We Do With Seaborn?

* Data Pre-Processing
* Data Visualization

While there are numerous ways to use Seaborn to gather useful information from data, I have the most experience in using it to create data visualizations, so this blog will go into more detail about using features related to those kinds of applications. 

## Data Visualization Tools in Seaborn

There are 17 built-in datasets that are available to use when importing Seaborn. The `sns.get_dataset_names()` function lists all the possible datasets one can choose from. For the content in this blog, I will be using the `tips` dataset, which provides information on tip amounts given `total_bill` amount ($), `sex` (M or F), `smoker` status, `day`, `time`, and party `size`.

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

#### Boxplots, Scatter-plots and Distribution Plots

To look at a graphical representation of the distribution of certain variables in a dataset, we can use boxplots. In Seaborn, the `sns.boxplot()` function allows us to to do this. There are many parameters that can be included, but the most basic required arguments are an `x` and `y` variable, as well as a `data` argument. To add specific asix and title labels, you can use the `.set()` function with any necessary parameters. 

{%- highlight python -%}
sns.boxplot(data = tips, 
            x = "size", 
            y = "tip").set(title = "Boxplot of Tip Amount by Party Size", 
                            ylabel = "Tips ($)", 
                            xlabel = "Party Size")
{%- endhighlight -%}

`scatterplot()` can be used to look at the relationship between two continuous variables, but Seaborn also has a lot of other features to make our plots more informative. For example, the plot below colors each data point by `size` so we can also understand the relationship between party size and amount spent all in one plot. 

{%- highlight python -%}
sns.scatterplot(data = tips, 
                x= "total_bill", 
                y = "tip", 
                hue = "size").set(title = "Scatterplot of Tip Amount by Total Bill Amount", 
                                ylabel = "Tips ($)", 
                                xlabel = "Bill Total ($)")
{%- endhighlight -%}

If we were interested in visualizing the distribution of variables in our dataset, Seaborn has a unique function `displot()` which allows for many different methods of visualizing various distributions. The example below uses a histogram to represent distributions of tip amounts for different times of service. 

{%- highlight python -%}
sns.displot(data = tips, 
            x = "tip", 
            col = "time", 
            kde = True).set(ylabel = "Frequency Count", 
                            xlabel = "Tip Amount ($)")
{%- endhighlight -%}

#### Pair Plots

The Seaborn `pairplot()` function allows us to see all the joint and marginal distributions for pairwise relationships occuring between the variables in our dataset.
