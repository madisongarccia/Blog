## Introduction

Opportunities in fields related to macine learning, data science, and statistics have grown immensely in recent years, and as students learning how to operate in this realm, it is important to be aware of all the tools available to you. A huge aspect of working in one of the fields listed, is data interpretation, and having the ability to communicate our findings to other career professionals. In order to do both of these jobs effectively, we will need certain tools to help us. One of the leading packages in Python for data visualization and manipulation is SciKit-Learn.


## What Can We Do With SciKit-Learn?

* Data Pre-Processing
* Data Visualization
* Model Selection
* Model Evaluation
* Model Deployment

While there are numerous ways to use SciKit-Learn to gather useful information from data, I have the most experience in using it to create data visualizations, so this blog will go into more detail about using features related to those kinds of applications.
